# FED2024Asg2_P04_Team6
This is Bryan Goh's and Teng Ren's FED Assignment

We were looking through the appendix and reading the scenario and realised the app looked really like current apps such as Carousell, Lazada, Shopee. We decided to take some ideas from these applications and combine them together to create the features that we have listed down above. There were some parts of the current available applications that we ourselves do not like and hence we decided to implement our own suggestions into our own MokeSell application. By using our own suggestions that we feel can improve those applications, we used it on our own application to produce a new and improved MokeSell idea that would take the world by storm and hopefully replace the current applications out there. MokeSell uses most of the features of the other applications and combines them together, so users do not need to go to different applications to do different things. We realised that MokeSell resembles Carousell the most which is partially why our idea stems from Carousell. However, instead of copying Carousell main design and their whole features we added our own. As stated, the colour scheme chosen was to allow users to feel comfortable while using the app. Our app has all the default features and new colour design which will make it stand out from others. We decided these features would benefit the app which is why we went for these ideas.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Assistive AI
In this section you should document the process of using AI tools eg, ChatGPT, Gemini etc to help you with the development of features/functionalities of your web application. (Failure to document your use of AI tools will result in loss of marks.) Example below:

Spotify API: ChatGPT was used to help with the implementation of the Spotify API (include screenshots of generated AI codes.)

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
